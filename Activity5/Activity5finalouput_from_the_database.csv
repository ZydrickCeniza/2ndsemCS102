"2989","alladin","2011-01-17","bend25",1," ranks among my top 10","Like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast Aladdin holds some of my fondest childhood memories Like the other two I watched this in the theaters even vividly remembering how I was annoyed that the princess was given a modern name Whats great about Aladdin is that Disney didnt try to duplicate Beauty which was arguably a huge hit Instead its the complete opposite of Beauty a quirkfilled comedy owned almost entirely by the Genie Robin Williams Artistically its also a departure from its predecessors Aladdin doesnt look like your typical Disney film Every object in the background is rounded like the characters and the style is more loose and cartoony The music is a notch down from Mermaid and Beauty but Prince Ali and A Whole New World hold up pretty well All in all another winner from Disney The Platinum Edition DVD is still available in most markets outside the US so grab one while you can"
"2990","alladin","2002-10-01","matttheraven",1," if not for robin williams","This movie woulda rated maybe a 7 The music is fun and the other character actors are decent enough but Williams adlibs and characteristically manic nature make this movie so much more enjoyable  I consider it my favorite Disney movie  than it wouldve been otherwise Though in reference to The Return of Jafar Dan Castenella was horrible as the Genie and Gilbert Gottfrieds Iago shown through as the comic star"
"2991","alladin","2013-12-27","angels_review",0.8," one of the better aladdin movies that came from disney","This show has a lot of good things going for it at least much more then the second movie The story line follows the book and yet it has a happier ending then that one Its not a real spoiler because if you havent seen this one you might have never seen this go out and watch it now Its a big classicThe characters are rather filled out the personalities fleshed out down to little details Its nice to get back to the classics Aladdin is the normal Robin Hood character he almost always looks after people who cant really fend for themselves even if he would go home hungry Although hes a street rat he dreams of being part of the world of aristocrats not starving and able to relax He is the opposite of Jasmine who is only trying to get away from it all and be free Both feel trapped in their own world I guess in a sense the Genie is also trapped so it makes them all more believable They feel each others pains and problemsJafar is one of the best Disney villains I think He does all the right moves and yet sometimes it seems like he uses Iago a little too much for his ideasSome little things are not bothersome in the artwork when Rasha bights the prince he has a piece of his boxers even though they are intact when he storms away Its little things like that that makes it not as good as it could be but when it was drawn on cells it is easy to excuse them When they bring in the CG though it looks rather bad though there arent many times they use itI like some of the voices Genies the most though Its so fun and comical that even at the most drama filled times he loosens it up Im not sure about the music though it just feels so childish I mean it fits the show well but I would have liked a little more adult fashioned songs too"
"2992","alladin","2024-01-07","hdoerr-02108",0.7," aladdin a timeless classic that will take you on a magical adventure","Ive been watching the classic Disney film Aladdin my whole life and its breathtaking animation catchy musical numbers and heartfelt storyline blew me away The film follows the charming street rat Aladdin who falls in love with the beautiful Princess Jasmine and sets out on a magical adventure to win her heartOne of the standout features of Aladdin is its unforgettable cast of characters including the lovable Genie the conniving Jafar and of course Aladdin and Jasmine themselves Each character is expertly crafted with unique personalities and motivations making them feel like real individuals rather than cartoon caricaturesThe films musical score also highlighted iconic songs like A Whole New World and Friend Like Me that have become timeless classics The animation itself is stunning with vibrant colors and intricate details that make every scene a feast for the eyesIt is a mustsee film for Disney fans of all ages Its a heartwarming story about love friendship and the power of believing in oneself that will leave you feeling uplifted and inspired I highly recommend it"
"2993","alladin","2004-10-08","glcrumpacker",1," viewing a classic in the light of 2004","I saw this movie and loved it when it was released but when my family and I sat down to watch the 2004 DVD release last night it was interesting to view this movie in the light of 2004The movie itself is good frenetic fun  very fastpaced due in large part to Robin Williams ADDafflicted Genie The oneliners and pop culture references fly so fast its hard to keep on top of them Still my kids liked the music and the quick tempo of the movie I could do without the love ballad A Whole New World Sounds too dated Disney saccharine these daysWhat added a strange sort of twist to the movie was viewing it for the first time in a post911 world The two primary male characters Aladdin and Jafar have distinctly Semitic sidekicks Gilbert Gottfried as the parrot and the Genie himself whose delivery is frequently borschtflavored Ironic that Also there are quite a lot of references to beheading and that gave me the heebiejeebies"

"2995","alladin","2015-11-22","m-ozfirat",0.9," good for childrens entertainment only","I have to admit though not scrupulous this is none the less an enjoyable film for children that is fun exotic and entertaining but being Disney uses a classic story to also teach American values in a clichd format Being a childrens film the characters are well developed and the story line is simple relying on comical humour that children will like and is recommended for the Primary school age group and is a good Disney film However despite being a Disney epic I would not say it is a classic film or one for family entertainment as I have seen other Aladdin films that would be better for a more mature and broader audience such as the elegant Japanese version made in the early 1980 as it keeps the story authentic and historical which is important from a cultural and educational standpoint Despite this the Disney version could of been marketed more as an Eastern Adventure rather then one based on a particular story The characters in the Disney version represent Iranian Americans epitomised in the fictional setting of Agrabah and does the story in a superficial manner some examples being Aladdin in the original is not a destitute underdog but a shrewd rogue the princess is called Badral but Jasmine sounds more American The story is not set in Iran but in Xinjiang Province now in Western China Jafar is two characters rolled in to one the haughty vizier and the chief antagonist who is a West African magician"

"2997","alladin","2021-01-19","patrickwelty",0.8," an absolute classic filled with stereotypes","Okay mid 90s and it was okay to hire mostly whites people to voice over for middle eastern actors which deserved the part This would not fly today and it shouldnt have then Times have a changed and I like to think of this was made today it would be diverse and inclusive of the culture it representsThe music is amazing and no one can deny that The animation and scenes are spectacular The story board was superbly done obviously Disney put serious time into the development of the charactersBest part of this Robin Williams So as I said before today he may not and should not have been cast but he was and left this gem Only RW could represent Genie like this in such a comedic way but with such passion and love It is likely the best voice over work ever performed in an animated movie It will go down as his crowning gem outside live action films such as Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting My goodness he was giftedChildren and adults can love this film for ages and remember the timeline it was made Iagos rants are legendary Enjoy Aladdin for its originality and its score for it is one of Disneys best of all time"
