"1","Survival probability of structures under fatigue: a data-based approach","Francois-Baptiste Cartiaux, Frederic Legoll, Alex Libal, Julien Reygner","Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science ","This article addresses the probabilistic nature of fatigue life in structures subjected to cyclic loading with variable amplitude. Drawing on the formalisation of Miners cumulative damage rule that we introduced in the recent article [Cartiaux Ehrlacher Legoll Libal and Reygner Prob. Eng. Mech. 2023] we apply our methodology to estimate the survival probability of an industrial structure using experimental data. The study considers both the randomness in the initial state of the structure and in the amplitude of loading cycles. The results indicate that the variability of loading cycles can be captured through the concept of deterministic equivalent damage providing a computationally efficient method for assessing the fatigue life of the structure. Furthermore the article highlights that the usual combination of Miners rule and of the weakest link principle systematically overestimates the structures fatigue life. On the case study that we consider this overestimation reaches a multiplicative factor of more than two. We then describe how the probabilistic framework that we have introduced offers a remedy to this overestimation.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 15:52:12 UTC (102 KB)"
"2","A Measure for Transparent Comparison of Linguistic Diversity in Multilingual NLP Data Sets","Tanja Samardzic, Ximena Gutierrez, Christian Bentz, Steven Moran, Olga Pelloni","Computation and Language ","Typologically diverse benchmarks are increasingly created to track the progress achieved in multilingual NLP. Linguistic diversity of these data sets is typically measured as the number of languages or language families included in the sample but such measures do not consider structural properties of the included languages. In this paper we propose assessing linguistic diversity of a data set against a reference language sample as a means of maximising linguistic diversity in the long run. We represent languages as sets of features and apply a version of the Jaccard index suitable for comparing sets of measures. In addition to the features extracted from typological data bases we propose an automatic textbased measure which can be used as a means of overcoming the wellknown problem of data sparsity in manually collected features. Our diversity score is interpretable in terms of linguistic features and can identify the types of languages that are not represented in a data set. Using our method we analyse a range of popular multilingual data sets (UD Bible100 mBERT XTREME XGLUE XNLI XCOPA TyDiQA XQuAD). In addition to ranking these data sets we find for example that (poly)synthetic languages are missing in almost all of them.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 18:14:22 UTC (879 KB)"
"3","Data-Based In-Cylinder Pressure Model with Cyclic Variations for Combustion Control: A RCCI Engine Application","Maarten Vlaswinkel, Frank Willems","Systems and Control ","Cylinder pressurebased control is a key enabler for advanced premixed combustion concepts. Besides guaranteeing robust and safe operation it allows for cylinder pressure and heat release shaping. This requires fast controloriented combustion models. Over the years meanvalue models have been proposed that can predict combustion measures (e.g. Gross Indicated Mean Effective Pressure or the crank angle where 50% of the total heat is released) or models that predict the full incylinder pressure. However these models are not able to capture cyclic variations. This is important in the control design for combustion concepts like Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition that can suffer from large cyclic variations. In this study the incylinder pressure and cyclic variation are modelled using a databased approach. The model combines Principle Component Decomposition and Gaussian Process Regression. A detailed study is performed on the effects of the different hyperparameters and kernel choices. The approach is applicable to any combustion concept but most valuable for advance combustion concepts with large cyclic variation. The potential of the proposed approach is demonstrated for an Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition engine running on Diesel and E85. The prediction quality of the evaluated combustion measures has an overall accuracy of 13.5% and 65.5% in mean behaviour and standard deviation respectively. The peakpressure riserate is traditionally hard to predict in the proposed model it has an accuracy of 22.7% and 96.4% in mean behaviour and standard deviation respectively. This Principle Component Decompositionbased approach is an important step towards incylinder pressure shaping. The use of Gaussian Process Regression provides important information on cyclic variation and provides nextcycle controls information on safety and performance criteria.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 10:44:55 UTC (3,347 KB)[v2] Thu, 7 Mar 2024 07:23:20 UTC (3,347 KB)"
"4","Multimodal Anomaly Detection based on Deep Auto-Encoder for Object Slip Perception of Mobile Manipulation Robots","Youngjae Yoo, Chung-Yeon Lee, Byoung-Tak Zhang","Robotics ","Object slip perception is essential for mobile manipulation robots to perform manipulation tasks reliably in the dynamic realworld. Traditional approaches to robot arms slip perception use tactile or vision sensors. However mobile robots still have to deal with noise in their sensor signals caused by the robots movement in a changing environment. To solve this problem we present an anomaly detection method that utilizes multisensory data based on a deep autoencoder model. The proposed framework integrates heterogeneous data streams collected from various robot sensors including RGB and depth cameras a microphone and a forcetorque sensor. The integrated data is used to train a deep autoencoder to construct latent representations of the multisensory data that indicate the normal status. Anomalies can then be identified by error scores measured by the difference between the trained encoders latent values and the latent values of reconstructed input data. In order to evaluate the proposed framework we conducted an experiment that mimics an object slip by a mobile service robot operating in a realworld environment with diverse household objects and different moving patterns. The experimental results verified that the proposed framework reliably detects anomalies in object slip situations despite various object types and robot behaviors and visual and auditory noise in the environment.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 09:15:53 UTC (7,762 KB)"
"5","Data based constitutive modelling of rate independent inelastic effects in composite cables using Preisach hysteresis operators","Davide Manfredo, Vanessa Dörlich, Joachim Linn, Martin Arnold","Materials Science ","This contribution aims at introducing first steps to develop hysteresis operator type inelastic constitutive laws for Cosserat rods for the simulation of cables composed of complex interior components. Motivated by the basic elements of Cosserat rod theory we develop a specific approach to constitutive modelling adapted for this application. Afterwards we describe the hysteretical behaviour arising from cyclic bending experiments on cables by means of the Preisach operator. As shown in pure bending experiments slender structures such as electric cables behave inelastically and open hysteresis loops arise with noticeable difference between the first load cycle and the following ones. The Preisach operator plays an important role in describing the inputoutput relation in hysteresis behaviours and it can be expressed as a superposition of relay operators. Hence a mathematical formulation of the problem is introduced and a first attempt is made to determine the hysteresis behaviour that describes the relation between curvature and bending moment. Therefore a suitable kernel function is identified in a way that its integration over the Preisach plane results in the bending moment of the specimen and a comparison between different kernel functions is performed.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 08:10:02 UTC (1,342 KB)"
"6","Modelling the inelastic constitutive behaviour of multi-layer spiral strands. Comparison of hysteresis operator approach to multi-scale model","Davide Manfredo, Mohammad Ali Saadat, Vanessa Dörlich, Joachim Linn, Damien Durville, Martin Arnold","Materials Science ","The simulation of inelastic effects in flexible slender technical devices has become of increasing interest in the past years. Different approaches have been considered depending on the effects relevant for the specific application. Recently a mixed stress strain driven computational homogenisation has been proposed to model the dissipative nonlinear bending response of spiral strands subjected to axial force. In this study we propose two different approaches namely a rheological model and a databased greybox model to predict the cyclic response of these strands using only their monotonic response. In the first approach a system of socalled bending springs and sliders is used to model different contributions to the bending stiffness of the strands. The databased approach makes use of mathematical tools called hysteresis operators. The PrandtlIshlinskii operator plays a relevant role in modelling the inputoutput relation in phenomena showing hysteretic behaviour and can be expressed as a weighted superposition of elementary stop operators. Comparing the two approaches leads to a better understanding and an explicit physical interpretation of the parameters of a specific class of hysteresis operator models.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 08:01:58 UTC (1,329 KB)"
"7","Leveraging Federated Learning for Automatic Detection of Clopidogrel Treatment Failures","Samuel Kim, Min Sang Kim","Machine Learning ","The effectiveness of clopidogrel a widely used antiplatelet medication varies significantly among individuals necessitating the development of precise predictive models to optimize patient care. In this study we leverage federated learning strategies to address clopidogrel treatment failure detection. Our research harnesses the collaborative power of multiple healthcare institutions allowing them to jointly train machine learning models while safeguarding sensitive patient data. Utilizing the UK Biobank dataset which encompasses a vast and diverse population we partitioned the data based on geographic centers and evaluated the performance of federated learning. Our results show that while centralized training achieves higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) values and faster convergence federated learning approaches can substantially narrow this performance gap. Our findings underscore the potential of federated learning in addressing clopidogrel treatment failure detection offering a promising avenue for enhancing patient care through personalized treatment strategies while respecting data privacy.

"8","Exploring Time Delay Interferometry Ranging as a Practical Ranging Technique in the Bayesian Framework","Minghui Du, Pengzhan Wu, Ziren Luo, Peng Xu","Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics ","Knowledge on the interspacecraft optical paths (i.e. delays) is one of the key elements of time delay interferometry (TDI). Conventional method for interspacecraft ranging mainly relies on the pseudorandom noise (PRN) code signal modulated onto the lasers. To ensure the reliability and robustness of this ranging information it would be highly beneficial to develop other methods which could serve as crossvalidations or backups. This paper explores the practical implementation of an alternative datadriven approach  time delay interferometry ranging (TDIR)  as a ranging technique independent of the PRN signal. Distinguished from previous research the inputs of our TDIR algorithm are interferometric measurements that have only undergone a 0.1 ms accuracy preliminary clock synchronization using the ground tracking data. This significantly relaxes the stringent requirement for clock synchronization imposed by traditional TDI procedure. In order to encode the information of timevarying light travel times and clock desynchronizations we adopt a general polynomial parametrization to represent the delays. By framing TDIR as a Bayesian parameter estimation problem we demonstrate our algorithm with simulated data based on the numerical orbit of Taiji. In the presence of laser frequency noise and secondary noises the estimated median values of parameters exhibit a bias of only 5.28 ns from the true delays capable of suppressing laser frequency noise to the desired level. Furthermore we have also analysed the requirements of mitigating optical bench noise and clock noise on TDIR and presented an illustrative example for the impact of laser locking.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 15:48:54 UTC (33,418 KB)[v2] Wed, 6 Mar 2024 07:36:26 UTC (33,442 KB)"

In this paper we carry out a case study to answer the following question Are LLMs capable of zeroshot human activity recognition (HAR). Our study HARGPT presents an affirmative answer by demonstrating that LLMs can comprehend raw IMU data and perform HAR tasks in a zeroshot manner with only appropriate prompts. HARGPT inputs raw IMU data into LLMs and utilizes the roleplay and think stepbystep strategies for prompting. We benchmark HARGPT on GPT4 using two public datasets of different interclass similarities and compare various baselines both based on traditional machine learning and stateoftheart deep classification models. Remarkably LLMs successfully recognize human activities from raw IMU data and consistently outperform all the baselines on both datasets. Our findings indicate that by effective prompting LLMs can interpret raw IMU data based on their knowledge base possessing a promising potential to analyze raw sensor data of the physical world effectively.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 07:34:51 UTC (2,188 KB)"

"11","A Novel Hybrid Feature Importance and Feature Interaction Detection Framework for Predictive Optimization in Industry 4.0 Applications","Zhipeng Ma, Bo Nørregaard Jørgensen, Zheng Grace Ma","Machine Learning ","Advanced machine learning algorithms are increasingly utilized to provide databased prediction and decisionmaking support in Industry 4.0. However the prediction accuracy achieved by the existing models is insufficient to warrant practical implementation in realworld applications. This is because not all features present in realworld datasets possess a direct relevance to the predictive analysis being conducted. Consequently the careful incorporation of select features has the potential to yield a substantial positive impact on the outcome. To address the research gap this paper proposes a novel hybrid framework that combines the feature importance detector  local interpretable modelagnostic explanations (LIME) and the feature interaction detector  neural interaction detection (NID) to improve prediction accuracy. By applying the proposed framework unnecessary features can be eliminated and interactions are encoded to generate a more conducive dataset for predictive purposes. Subsequently the proposed model is deployed to refine the prediction of electricity consumption in foundry processing. The experimental outcomes reveal an augmentation of up to 9.56% in the R2 score and a diminution of up to 24.05% in the root mean square error.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 13:22:53 UTC (853 KB)"
"12","Canonical Form of Datatic Description in Control Systems","Guojian Zhan, Ziang Zheng, Shengbo Eben Li","Systems and Control ","The design of feedback controllers is undergoing a paradigm shift from modelic (i.e. modeldriven) control to datatic (i.e. datadriven) control. Canonical form of state space model is an important concept in modelic control systems exemplified by Jordan form controllable form and observable form whose purpose is to facilitate system analysis and controller synthesis. In the realm of datatic control there is a notable absence in the standardization of databased system representation. This paper for the first time introduces the concept of canonical data form for the purpose of achieving more effective design of datatic controllers. In a control system the data sample in canonical form consists of a transition component and an attribute component. The former encapsulates the plant dynamics at the sampling time independently which is a tuple containing three elements a state an action and their corresponding next state. The latter describes one or some artificial characteristics of the current sample whose calculation must be performed in an online manner. The attribute of each sample must adhere to two requirements (1) causality ensuring independence from any future samples; and (2) locality allowing dependence on historical samples but constrained to a finite neighboring set. The purpose of adding attribute is to offer some kinds of benefits for controller design in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. To provide a more closeup illustration we present two canonical data forms temporal form and spatial form and demonstrate their advantages in reducing instability and enhancing training efficiency in two datatic control systems.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 06:53:38 UTC (3,978 KB)"
"13","On the Model-Agnostic Multi-Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation","Jiangbo Pei, Ruizhe Li, Qingchao Chen","Machine Learning ","MultiSourceFree Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (MSFDA) aims to transfer knowledge from multiple welllabeled source domains to an unlabeled target domain using source models instead of source data. Existing MSFDA methods limited that each source domain provides only a single model with a uniform structure. This paper introduces a new MSFDA setting ModelAgnostic MultiSourceFree Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (MMDA) allowing diverse source models with varying architectures without quantitative restrictions. While MMDA holds promising potential incorporating numerous source models poses a high risk of including undesired models which highlights the source model selection problem. To address it we first provide a theoretical analysis of this problem. We reveal two fundamental selection principles transferability principle and diversity principle and introduce a selection algorithm to integrate them. Then considering the measure of transferability is challenging we propose a novel SourceFree Unsupervised Transferability Estimation (SUTE). This novel formulation enables the assessment and comparison of transferability across multiple source models with different architectures in the context of domain shift without requiring access to any target labels or source data. Based on the above we introduce a new framework to address MMDA. Specifically we first conduct source model selection based on the proposed selection principles. Subsequently we design two modules to aggregate knowledge from included models and recycle useful knowledge from excluded models. These modules enable us to leverage source knowledge efficiently and effectively thereby supporting us in learning a discriminative target model via adaptation. We validate the effectiveness of our method through numerous experimental results and demonstrate that our approach achieves stateoftheart performance.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 18:22:39 UTC (16,003 KB)"
"14","MulCogBench: A Multi-modal Cognitive Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating Chinese and English Computational Language Models","Yunhao Zhang, Xiaohan Zhang, Chong Li, Shaonan Wang, Chengqing Zong","Computation and Language ","Pretrained computational language models have recently made remarkable progress in harnessing the language abilities which were considered unique to humans. Their success has raised interest in whether these models represent and process language like humans. To answer this question this paper proposes MulCogBench a multimodal cognitive benchmark dataset collected from native Chinese and English participants. It encompasses a variety of cognitive data including subjective semantic ratings eyetracking functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). To assess the relationship between language models and cognitive data we conducted a similarityencoding analysis which decodes cognitive data based on its pattern similarity with textual embeddings. Results show that language models share significant similarities with human cognitive data and the similarity patterns are modulated by the data modality and stimuli complexity. Specifically contextaware models outperform contextindependent models as language stimulus complexity increases. The shallow layers of contextaware models are better aligned with the hightemporalresolution MEG signals whereas the deeper layers show more similarity with the highspatialresolution fMRI. These results indicate that language models have a delicate relationship with brain language representations. Moreover the results between Chinese and English are highly consistent suggesting the generalizability of these findings across languages.","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 07:49:57 UTC (1,450 KB)"

In this study we investigate the extent to which technological innovation contributes to a more sustainable future and fosters entrepreneurship. To examine this we focus on robotic process automation (RPA) highly relevant technology. We conducted a comprehensive analysis by examining the usage of RPA and its impact on environmental social and governance (ESG) factors. Our research involved gathering data from the 300 largest companies in terms of market capitalization. We assessed whether these companies used RPA and obtained their corresponding ESG ratings. To investigate the relationship between RPA and ESG we employed a contingency table analysis which involved categorizing the data based on ESG ratings. We further used Pearsons Chisquare Test of Independence to assess the impact of RPA on ESG. Our findings revealed a statistically significant association between RPA and ESG ratings indicating their interconnection. The calculated value for Pearsons Chisquare Test of Independence was 6.54 with a corresponding pvalue of 0.0381. This indicates that at a significance level of five percent the RPA and ESG variables depend on each other. These results suggest that RPA representative of modern technologies likely influences the achievement of a sustainable future and the promotion of entrepreneurship. In conclusion our study provides empirical evidence supporting the notion that technological innovations such as RPA have the potential to positively shape sustainability efforts and entrepreneurial endeavours.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 10:32:48 UTC (279 KB)"

These control problems are such that besides stabilization some additional performance requirements must be satisfied. First we formulate and solve a trajectoryreference control problem on which desired closedloop trajectories are known and a controller that allows the system to closely follow those trajectories is computed. Then in the area of databased optimal control we solve two different problems the inverse problem of optimal control and the solution of the LQR problem for continuoustime systems. Finally we consider the case in which the precise position of the desired poles of the closedloop system is known and introduce a databased variant of a robust poleplacement procedure. Although we focus on continuoustime systems all of the presented methods can also be easily formulated for the discretetime case.

However convincing methods for general time series data augmentation still leaves much to be desired especially since the methods developed for these models do not readily crossover. Three common approaches for time series data augmentation include (i) Constructing a physicsbased model and then imbuing uncertainty over the coefficient space (for example) (ii) Adding noise to the observed data set(s) and (iii) Having access to ample amounts of time series data sets from which a robust generative neural network model can be trained. However for many practical problems that work with time series data in the industry (i) One usually does not have access to a robust physical model (ii) The addition of noise can in of itself require large or difficult assumptions (for example what probability distribution should be used? Or how large should the noise variance be?) and (iii) In practice it can be difficult to source a large representative time series data base with which to train the neural network model for the underlying problem. In this paper we propose a methodology which attempts to simultaneously tackle all three of these previous limitations to a large extent. The method relies upon the wellstudied matrix differential geometry of the Stiefel manifold as it proposes a simple way in which time series signals can placed on and then smoothly perturbed over the manifold. We attempt to clarify how this method works by showcasing several potential use cases which in particular work to take advantage of the unique properties of this underlying manifold.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:52:21 UTC (43,943 KB)"

Although obtaining and translating domainspecific data incurs high costs it is inevitable for highquality translations. Hence finding the most effective data with an unsupervised setting becomes a practical strategy for reducing labeling costs. Recent research indicates that this effective data could be found by selecting properly difficult data based on its volume. This means the data should not be excessively challenging or overly simplistic especially if the amount of data is limited. However we found that establishing a criterion for unsupervised data selection remains challenging as the proper difficulty might vary based on the data domain being trained on. We introduce a novel unsupervised data selection method Capturing Perplexing Named Entities which adopts the maximum inference entropy in translated named entities as a selection measure. The motivation was that named entities in domainspecific data are considered the most complex portion of the data and should be predicted with high confidence. When verified with the KoreanEnglish Parallel Corpus of Specialized Domains our method served as a robust guidance for unsupervised data selection in contrast to existing methods.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:38:28 UTC (319 KB)"

In particular we focus on the quantum phase diagram of the bilayer antiferromagnetic TFIM on the triangular lattice with an Isingtype interlayer coupling. Without a field the model is known to host a classically disordered ground state and in the limit of decoupled layers it exhibits the 3dXY order by disorder transition of the corresponding singlelayer model. Our starting point for the unknown parts of the phase diagram is a highorder perturbative calculation about the limit of isolated dimers where the model is in a gapped phase.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 09:43:54 UTC (2,112 KB)"

The study addresses the uncertainty arising from the growing complexity of modern products. The method uses scenario analysis and focuses on failure analysis within technical product development. The approach involves a derivation of influencing factors based on information from failure databases. The failures described here are documented individually in failure sequence diagrams and then related to each other in a relationship matrix. This creates a network of possible failure scenarios from individual failure cases that can be used in product development. To illustrate the application of the methodology a case study of 41 Rapex safety alerts for a hair dryer is presented. The failure sequence diagrams and influencing factor relationship matrices show 46 influencing factors that lead to safetyrelated failures. The predominant harm is burns and electric shocks which are highlighted by the active and passive sum diagrams.

A common approach considers the generation of synthetic data to be disclosed instead of the original data. Efficient approaches ought to deal with the tradeoff between reliability and confidentiality of the released data. Ultimately the aim is to be able to reproduce as accurately as possible statistical analysis of the original data using the synthetic one. Bayesian networks is a modelbased approach that can be used to parsimoniously estimate the underlying distribution of the original data and generate synthetic datasets. These ought to not only approximate the results of analyses with the original data but also robustly quantify the uncertainty involved in the approximation. This paper proposes a fully Bayesian approach to generate and analyze synthetic data based on the posterior predictive distribution of statistics of the synthetic data allowing for efficient uncertainty quantification. The methodology makes use of probability properties of the model to devise a computationally efficient algorithm to obtain the target predictive distributions via Monte Carlo.

To compare models quantitative reasoning abilities on data and text we enrich the benchmark with an auxiliary set of 290 textonly questions namely QRText. We evaluate natural language reasoning programbased reasoning and agent reasoning methods including ChainofThought ProgramofThoughts ReAct and code interpreter assistants on diverse models. The strongest model GPT4 achieves an accuracy of 58% which has a large room for improvement. Among opensource models Deepseekcoderinstruct a code LLM pretrained on 2T tokens gets the highest accuracy of 37%.

"25","Robust Radiotherapy Planning with Spatially Based Uncertainty Sets","Noam Goldberg, Mark P. Langer, Shimrit Shtern","Optimization and Control ","Radiotherapy treatment planning is a challenging largescale optimization problem plagued by uncertainty. Following the robust optimization methodology we propose a novel spatially based uncertainty set for robust modeling of radiotherapy planning producing solutions that are immune to unexpected changes in biological conditions. Our proposed uncertainty set realistically captures biological radiosensitivity patterns that are observed using recent advances in imaging while its parameters can be personalized for individual patients. We exploit the structure of this set to devise a compact reformulation of the robust model. We develop a rowgeneration scheme to solve real largescale instances of the robust model. This method is then extended to a relaxationbased scheme for enforcing challenging yet clinically important dosevolume cardinality constraints. The computational performance of our algorithms as well as the quality and robustness of the computed treatment plans are demonstrated on simulated and real imaging data. Based on accepted performance measures such as minimal target dose and homogeneity these examples demonstrate that the spatially robust model achieves almost the same performance as the nominal model in the nominal scenario and otherwise the spatial model outperforms both the nominal and the boxuncertainty models.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 21:44:56 UTC (7,294 KB)"

In this study we explore the feasibility of leveraging generated data as a replacement for fetching data in missing scenarios based on content locality. Due to sufficient local computing resources and reliable generation efficiency we propose a contentoriented generativehit framework (CoGenT) for CDNs. CoGenT utilizes idle computing resources on edge nodes to generate requested data based on similar or related cached data to achieve hits. Our implementation in a realworld system demonstrates that CoGenT reduces the average access latency by half. Additionally experiments conducted on a simulator also confirm that CoGenT can enhance existing caching algorithms resulting in reduced latency and bandwidth usage.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 02:54:04 UTC (2,287 KB)"

Accurately determining the Szone radius requires the precise location of the user equipment (UE) and data base stations (DBSs). Even a slight error in reported positions of DBSs or UE will lead to an incorrect determination of Szone radius and UEDBS pairing leading to degradation of the UEDBS communication link. To compensate for the positioning error impact and improve the ASE and EE of the UCUDN this work proposes a datadriven optimization and error compensation (DDOEC) framework. The framework comprises an additional machine learning model that assesses the impact of residual errors and regulates the erroneous datadriven optimization to output Szone radius transmit power and DBS density values which improve network ASE and EE. The performance of the framework is compared to a baseline scheme which does not employ the residual and results demonstrate that the DDOEC framework outperforms the baseline achieving up to a 23% improvement in performance.","Sat, 24 Feb 2024 11:47:22 UTC (3,430 KB)"

Risk estimation is an important task in insurance as it is a necessary step for determining premiums under various policy terms. Spectral risk measures are inherently coherent and have the benefit of connecting the risk measure to the users risk aversion. In this paper we study the estimation of spectral risk measure based on left truncated and right censored data. We propose a non parametric estimator of spectral risk measure using the product limit estimator and establish the asymptotic normality for our proposed estimator. We also develop an Edgeworth expansion of our proposed estimator. The bootstrap is employed to approximate the distribution of our proposed estimator and shown to be second order ``accurate. Monte Carlo studies are conducted to compare the proposed spectral risk measure estimator with the existing parametric and non parametric estimators for left truncated and right censored data.

First it provides predictions in the form of the expected event time and the survival function for a new generated feature vector on the basis of the Beran estimator. Second the model generates additional data based on a given training set that would supplement the original dataset. Third the most important it generates a prototype timedependent trajectory for an object which characterizes how features of the object could be changed to achieve a different time to an event. The trajectory can be viewed as a type of the counterfactual explanation. The proposed model is robust during training and inference due to a specific weighting scheme incorporating into the variational autoencoder. The model also determines the censored indicators of new generated data by solving a classification task.

It has been reported that the stimuliresponsive gel with an inhomogeneous structure exhibits faster volume change than the gel without it. It is understood as a difference in the transfer dynamics of the solvent though there are few models for discussing the effect of inhomogeneity explicitly. In this paper we propose a simple model for the kinetics of volume change by introducing inhomogeneity as the probability distribution for a random variable that characterizes the structure. Under this framework we demonstrate that inhomogeneity actually increases the rate of volume change. Furthermore through analysis of a simplified example we show that some features that are often seen in experiments can be reproduced by the model. This model provides a simple equation for the time series of volume change that can be used to characterize the experimental data based on a simple physical picture of the phenomenon.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 17:24:35 UTC (45 KB)"

This paper introduces a novel attack scenario wherein an attacker adversarially finetunes pretrained LMs to amplify the exposure of the original training data. This strategy differs from prior studies by aiming to intensify the LMs retention of its pretraining dataset. To achieve this the attacker needs to collect generated texts that are closely aligned with the pretraining data. However without knowledge of the actual dataset quantifying the amount of pretraining data within generated texts is challenging. To address this we propose the use of pseudolabels for these generated texts leveraging membership approximations indicated by machinegenerated probabilities from the target LM. We subsequently finetune the LM to favor generations with higher likelihoods of originating from the pretraining data based on their membership probabilities. Our empirical findings indicate a remarkable outcome LMs with over 1B parameters exhibit a four to eightfold increase in training data exposure. We discuss potential mitigations and suggest future research directions.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 14:52:50 UTC (277 KB)"

Therefore developing realistic camera and Lidar simulation methods also known as camera and Lidar models is of paramount importance to effectively conduct simulationbased testing for ADS. Moreover the rise of deep learningbased perception models has propelled the prevalence of perception sensor models as valuable tools for synthesising diverse training datasets. The traditional sensor simulation methods rely on computationally expensive physicsbased algorithms specifically in complex systems such as ADS. Hence the current potential resides in learningbased models driven by the success of deep generative models in synthesising highdimensional data. This paper reviews the current stateoftheart in learningbased sensor simulation methods and validation approaches focusing on two main types of perception sensors cameras and Lidars. This review covers two categories of learningbased approaches namely rawdatabased and objectbased models. Rawdatabased methods are explained concerning the employed learning strategy while objectbased models are categorised based on the type of error considered.

"37","An Approximation Based Theory of Linear Regression","Laurie Davies","Methodology ","The goal of this paper is to provide a theory linear regression based entirely on approximations. It will be argued that the standard linear regression model based theory whether frequentist or Bayesian has failed and that this failure is due to an assumed (revealed?) truth (John Tukey) attitude to the models. This is reflected in the language of statistical inference which involves a concept of truth for example efficiency consistency and hypothesis testing. The motivation behind this paper was to remove the word `true from the theory and practice of linear regression and to replace it by approximation. The approximations considered are the least squares approximations. An approximation is called valid if it contains no irrelevant covariates. This is operationalized using the concept of a Gaussian Pvalue which is the probability that pure Gaussian noise is better in term of least squares than the covariate. The precise definition given in the paper is intuitive and requires only four simple equations. Given this a valid approximation is one where all the Gaussian Pvalues are less than a threshold $p0$ specified by the statistician in this paper with the default value 0.01. This approximations approach is not only much simpler it is overwhelmingly better than the standard model based approach. This will be demonstrated using six real data sets four from high dimensional regression and two from vector autoregression. Both the simplicity and the superiority of Gaussian Pvalues derive from their universal exactness and validity. This is in complete contrast to standard F Pvalues which are valid only for carefully designed simulations. The paper contains excerpts from an unpublished paper by John Tukey entitled `Issues relevant to an honest account of databased inference partially in the light of Laurie Daviess paper.","Thu, 15 Feb 2024 10:23:48 UTC (702 KB)"

We train neural networks using historical daily gridded precipitation data for India obtained from IMD for the time period $1901 2022$ at a spatial resolution of $1^{circ} 	imes 1^{circ}$. This is compared with the numerical weather prediction (NWP) forecasts obtained from NCEP (National Centre for Environmental Prediction) available for the period 20112022. We conduct a detailed country wide analysis and separately analyze some of the most populated cities in India. Our conclusion is that forecasts obtained by applying deep learning to historical rainfall data are more accurate compared to NWP forecasts as well as predictions based on persistence. On average compared to our predictions forecasts from NCEPNWP model have about 34% higher error for a single day prediction and over 68% higher error for a three day prediction. Similarly persistence estimates report a 29% higher error in a single day forecast and over 54% error in a three day forecast. We further observe that data up to 20 days in the past is useful in reducing errors of one and three day forecasts when a transformer based learning architecture and to a lesser extent when an LSTM is used. A key conclusion suggested by our preliminary analysis is that NWP forecasts can be substantially improved upon through more and diverse data relevant to monsoon prediction combined with carefully selected neural network architecture.","Mon, 12 Feb 2024 17:59:20 UTC (27,478 KB)"

In this context we consider a general regression problem where the empirical risk is regularized by a partial differential equation that quantifies the physical inconsistency. We prove that for linear differential priors the problem can be formulated as a kernel regression task. Taking advantage of kernel theory we derive convergence rates for the minimizer of the regularized risk and show that it converges at least at the Sobolev minimax rate. However faster rates can be achieved depending on the physical error. This principle is illustrated with a onedimensional example supporting the claim that regularizing the empirical risk with physical information can be beneficial to the statistical performance of estimators.","Mon, 12 Feb 2024 09:38:42 UTC (1,863 KB)"

To begin some traffic and weather data are acquired as raw data. This data is then analyzed and relevant characteristics are chosen to utilize as input data based on additional tree and Pearson correlation. Furthermore crash and noncrash time data are separated; then feature values for crash and noncrash events are written in three fourminute intervals prior to the crash and noncrash events using the average of all available values for that period. The number of noncrash samples was lowered after calculating crash likelihood for each period based on accident labeling. The proposed CNN model is capable of learning from recorded processed and categorized input characteristics such as traffic characteristics and meteorological conditions. The goal of this work is to forecast the chance of a realtime crash based on three periods before events. The area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) as well as sensitivity as the true positive rate and specificity as the false positive rate are shown and compared with three typical machine learning and neural network models. Finally when it comes to the error value AUC sensitivity and specificity parameters as performance variables the executed model outperforms other models. The findings of this research suggest applying the CNN model as a multiclass prediction model for realtime crash risk prediction. Our emphasis is on multiclass prediction while prior research used this for binary (twoclass) categorization like crash and noncrash.","Fri, 9 Feb 2024 10:51:09 UTC (1,147 KB)"

We provide an economic rationale for the support of databased services that is from the point of view of the profits attained by the service providers and operators (SP).

"48","Baryon Spin and Emergent Hadron Mass","Peng Cheng","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology ","This thesis describes the use of DysonSchwinger equations (DSEs) to study baryon bound states in QCD. In this work octet baryon axial form factors are calculated using a symmetrypreserving treatment of a vector $	imes$ vector contact interaction (SCI). The baryons are considered as quarkplusinteractingdiquark bound states whose structure (wave function) is obtained by solving a Poincarécovariant Faddeev equation. Since it preserves symmetries all consequences of partial conservation of the axial current are manifest. For instance one finds that octet baryon axial properties are consistent with only minor violations of SU(3)flavour symmetry being interpreted as a dynamical consequence of emergent hadron mass (EHM). Considering neutral axial currents the SCI delivers predictions for the flavour separation of octet baryon axial charges and consequently produces values for the associated SU(3) singlet triplet and octet axial charges. The results indicate that at the hadron scale $zeta_{mathcal{H}}$ valence degrees of freedom carry approximately $50\%$ of an octet baryons total spin. Proton structure is one of the principal topics in hadron physics. Its study is expected to reveal key features of both the origin of mass and strong interaction dynamics. This work therefore extended the above analyses to an examination of inproton parton helicity (spin) distribution functions (DFs). Using Ansätze for hadronscale proton polarised valence quark DFs predictions are delivered for all proton polarised DFs at the measurement scale $zeta_{m C}^2 = 3$GeV$^2$. The pointwise behaviour of the predicted DFs and consequently their moments shows good agreement with results inferred from data. Based on these results one finds that experimental measurements of the proton flavoursinglet axial charge should return a value $a_0^{m E}(zeta_{m C}) = 0.35(2)$.","Fri, 2 Feb 2024 13:57:29 UTC (1,890 KB)"

"51","Spatial-temporal-demand clustering for solving large-scale vehicle routing problems with time windows","Christoph Kerscher, Stefan Minner","Artificial Intelligence ","Several metaheuristics use decomposition and pruning strategies to solve largescale instances of the vehicle routing problem (VRP). Those complexity reduction techniques often rely on simple problemspecific rules. However the growth in available data and advances in computer hardware enable databased approaches that use machine learning (ML) to improve scalability of solution algorithms. We propose a decomposerouteimprove (DRI) framework that groups customers using clustering. Its similarity metric incorporates customers spatial temporal and demand data and is formulated to reflect the problems objective function and constraints. The resulting subrouting problems can independently be solved using any suitable algorithm. We apply pruned local search (LS) between solved subproblems to improve the overall solution. Pruning is based on customers similarity information obtained in the decomposition phase. In a computational study we parameterize and compare existing clustering algorithms and benchmark the DRI against the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) of Vidal et al. (2013). Results show that our databased approach outperforms classic clusterfirst routesecond approaches solely based on customers spatial information. The newly introduced similarity metric forms separate subVRPs and improves the selection of LS moves in the improvement phase. Thus the DRI scales existing metaheuristics to achieve highquality solutions faster for largescale VRPs by efficiently reducing complexity. Further the DRI can be easily adapted to various solution methods and VRP characteristics such as distribution of customer locations and demands depot location and different time window scenarios making it a generalizable approach to solving routing problems.","Sat, 20 Jan 2024 06:06:01 UTC (327 KB)"
"52","Projection-based reduced order modeling and data-driven artificial viscosity closures for incompressible fluid flows","Aviral Prakash, Yongjie Jessica Zhang","Fluid Dynamics ","Projectionbased reduced order models rely on offlineonline model decomposition where the databased energetic spatial basis is used in the expensive offline stage to obtain equations of reduced states that evolve in time during the inexpensive online stage. The online stage requires a solution method for the dynamic evolution of the coupled system of pressure and velocity states for incompressible fluid flows. The first contribution of this article is to demonstrate the applicability of the incremental pressure correction scheme for the dynamic evolution of pressure and velocity states. The evolution of a large number of these reduced states in the online stage can be expensive. In contrast the accuracy significantly decreases if only a few reduced states are considered while not accounting for the interactions between unresolved and resolved states. The second contribution of this article is to compare three closure model forms based on global modal and tensor artificial viscosity approximation to account for these interactions. The unknown model parameters are determined using two calibration techniques least squares minimization of error in energy approximation and closure term approximation. This article demonstrates that an appropriate selection of solution methods and datadriven artificial viscosity closure models is essential for consistently accurate dynamics forecasting of incompressible fluid flows.","Tue, 30 Jan 2024 19:09:36 UTC (4,311 KB)"

Conversely machine learning approaches while powerful face challenges in interpretability and in handling physical constraints. Efforts to combine these models often often stumble upon difficulties in finding a balance between accuracy and complexity. To address these issues we propose a comprehensive framework based on a mixture of experts rationale. This approach enables the databased fusion of diverse local models leveraging the full potential of firstprinciplebased priors. Our solution allows independent training of experts drawing on techniques from both machine learning and system identification and it supports both collaborative and competitive learning paradigms. To enhance interpretability we penalize abrupt variations in the experts combination.

For such equations standard techniques for functional data based on crosssectional covariances are often inadequate for identifying statistically relevant random drivers and detecting outliers since they overlook the interplay between crosssectional and temporal structures. Therefore we develop an estimation theory for the continuous quadratic covariation of the latent random driver of the equation instead of a static covariance of the observable solution process. We derive identifiability results under weak conditions establish rates of convergence and a central limit theorem based on infill asymptotics and provide longtime asymptotics for estimation of a static covariation of the latent driver. Applied to term structure data our approach uncovers a fundamental alignment with scaling limits of covariations of specific shortterm trading strategies and an empirical study detects several jumps and indicates highdimensional and timevarying covariations.","Mon, 29 Jan 2024 16:46:10 UTC (1,151 KB)"
"55","Contributing Dimension Structure of Deep Feature for Coreset Selection","Zhijing Wan, Zhixiang Wang, Yuran Wang, Zheng Wang, Hongyuan Zhu, Shinichi Satoh","Machine Learning ","Coreset selection seeks to choose a subset of crucial training samples for efficient learning. It has gained traction in deep learning particularly with the surge in training dataset sizes. Sample selection hinges on two main aspects a samples representation in enhancing performance and the role of sample diversity in averting overfitting. Existing methods typically measure both the representation and diversity of data based on similarity metrics such as L2norm. They have capably tackled representation via distribution matching guided by the similarities of features gradients or other information between data. However the results of effectively diverse sample selection are mired in suboptimality. This is because the similarity metrics usually simply aggregate dimension similarities without acknowledging disparities among the dimensions that significantly contribute to the final similarity. As a result they fall short of adequately capturing diversity. To address this we propose a featurebased diversity constraint compelling the chosen subset to exhibit maximum diversity. Our key lies in the introduction of a novel Contributing Dimension Structure (CDS) metric. Different from similarity metrics that measure the overall similarity of highdimensional features our CDS metric considers not only the reduction of redundancy in feature dimensions but also the difference between dimensions that contribute significantly to the final similarity. We reveal that existing methods tend to favor samples with similar CDS leading to a reduced variety of CDS types within the coreset and subsequently hindering model performance. In response we enhance the performance of five classical selection methods by integrating the CDS constraint. Our experiments on three datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness of the proposed method in boosting existing methods.","Mon, 29 Jan 2024 14:47:26 UTC (1,009 KB)[v2] Sat, 2 Mar 2024 08:27:52 UTC (1,786 KB)"

Recently our work X23D showed an approach for generating 3D anatomical models of the spine from only a few intraoperative fluoroscopic images. This negates the need for conventional registrationbased surgical navigation by creating a direct intraoperative 3D reconstruction of the anatomy. Despite these strides the practical application of X23D has been limited by a domain gap between synthetic training data and real intraoperative images. In response we devised a novel data collection protocol for a paired dataset consisting of synthetic and real fluoroscopic images from the same perspectives. Utilizing this dataset we refined our deep learning model via transfer learning effectively bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real Xray data. A novel style transfer mechanism also allows us to convert real Xrays to mirror the synthetic domain enabling our insilicotrained X23D model to achieve high accuracy in realworld settings. Our results demonstrated that the refined model can rapidly generate accurate 3D reconstructions of the entire lumbar spine from as few as three intraoperative fluoroscopic shots. It achieved an 84% F1 score matching the accuracy of our previous synthetic databased research. Additionally with a computational time of only 81.1 ms our approach provides realtime capabilities essential for surgery integration. Through examining ideal imaging setups and view angle dependencies weve further confirmed our systems practicality and dependability in clinical settings. Our research marks a significant step forward in intraoperative 3D reconstruction offering enhancements to surgical planning navigation and robotics.","Mon, 29 Jan 2024 10:22:45 UTC (14,396 KB)"

This model focuses on the way traffic jams spread through a network of streets where the first street that becomes congested represents the bottleneck of the jam. We extended the model by integrating additional realistic jam components into the model and find that while the locations of traffic jams can vary significantly from day to day and hour to hour the daily distribution of the costs associated with these jams follows a consistent pattern i.e. a power law with similar exponents. This distribution pattern appears to hold not only for a given region on different days but also for the same hours on different days. This daily pattern of exponent values for traffic jams can be used as a fingerprint for urban traffic i.e. jamprints. Our findings are useful for quantifying the reliability of urban traffic system and for improving traffic management and control.","Sat, 27 Jan 2024 15:05:17 UTC (3,478 KB)"

This is a limiting factor when it comes to leveraging sleep stages for therapeutic purposes. With increasing affordability and expansion of wearable devices automating SSC may enable deployment of sleepbased therapies at scale. Deep Learning has gained increasing attention as a potential method to automate this process. Previous research has shown accuracy comparable to manual expert scores. However previous approaches require sizable amount of memory and computational resources. This constrains the ability to classify in real time and deploy models on the edge. To address this gap we aim to provide a model capable of predicting sleep stages in realtime without requiring access to external computational sources (e.g. mobile phone cloud). The algorithm is power efficient to enable use on embedded battery powered systems. Our compact sleep stage classifier can be deployed on most offtheshelf microcontrollers (MCU) with constrained hardware settings. This is due to the memory footprint of our approach requiring significantly fewer operations. The model was tested on three publicly available data bases and achieved performance comparable to the state of the art whilst reducing model complexity by orders of magnitude (up to 280 times smaller compared to state of the art).

Gary Wang","Machine Learning ","Considering data insufficiency in metal additive manufacturing (AM) transfer learning (TL) has been adopted to extract knowledge from source domains (e.g. completed printings) to improve the modeling performance in target domains (e.g. new printings). Current applications use all accessible source data directly in TL with no regard to the similarity between source and target data. This paper proposes a systematic method to find appropriate subsets of source data based on similarities between the source and target datasets for a given set of limited target domain data. Such similarity is characterized by the spatial and model distance metrics. A Pareto frontierbased source data selection method is developed where the source data located on the Pareto frontier defined by two similarity distance metrics are selected iteratively. The method is integrated into an instancebased TL method (decision tree regression model) and a modelbased TL method (finetuned artificial neural network). Both models are then tested on several regression tasks in metal AM. Comparison results demonstrate that 1) the source data selection method is general and supports integration with various TL methods and distance metrics 2) compared with using all source data the proposed method can find a small subset of source data from the same domain with better TL performance in metal AM regression tasks involving different processes and machines and 3) when multiple source domains exist the source data selection method could find the subset from one source domain to obtain comparable or better TL performance than the model constructed using data from all source domains.","Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:14:37 UTC (891 KB)"

The capability of robots to similarly grasp and perform inhand manipulation of objects is critical for their use in the ever changing human environment and for their ability to replace manpower. In recent decades significant effort has been put in order to enable inhand manipulation capabilities to robotic systems. Initial robotic manipulators followed carefully programmed paths while later attempts provided a solution based on analytical modeling of motion and contact. However these have failed to provide practical solutions due to inability to cope with complex environments and uncertainties. Therefore the effort has shifted to learningbased approaches where data is collected from the real world or through a simulation during repeated attempts to complete various tasks. The vast majority of learning approaches focused on learning databased models that describe the system to some extent or Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL in particular has seen growing interest due to the remarkable ability to generate solutions to problems with minimal human guidance.

To remove the need for the persistently exciting (PE) condition of a sufficiently high order on precollected data a set containing all systems capable of generating such data is constructed. Then at each time step an upper bound of a given objective function is derived for all systems in the set and a feedback controller is designed to minimize this bound. The optimal control gain at each time step is determined by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. We prove that if the synthesis problem is feasible at the initial time step it remains feasible for all future time steps. Unlike current datadriven predictive control schemes based on behavioral system theory our approach requires less stringent conditions for the precollected data facilitating easier implementation. Further the proposed predictive control scheme features an infinite prediction horizon potentially resulting in superior overall control performance compared to existing methods with finite prediction horizons.

Reward models are trained as proxies for human preferences to drive reinforcement learning optimization. While reward models are often considered central to achieving high performance they face the following challenges in practical applications (1) Incorrect and ambiguous preference pairs in the dataset may hinder the reward model from accurately capturing human intent. (2) Reward models trained on data from a specific distribution often struggle to generalize to examples outside that distribution and are not suitable for iterative RLHF training.

For fundamental and practical reasons it is highly desirable to add to the existing data base of analytical functional forms for such pair statistics. Here we design a plethora of such pair functions in direct and Fourier spaces across the first three Euclidean space dimensions that are realizable by diverse manyparticle systems with varying degrees of correlated disorder across length scales spanning a wide spectrum of hyperuniform typical nonhyperuniform and antihyperuniform ones. This is accomplished by utilizing an efficient inverse algorithm that determines equilibrium states with up to pair interactions at positive temperature that precisely match targeted forms for both $g_2(r)$ and $S(k)$. Among other results we realize an example with the strongest hyperuniform property among known positivetemperature equilibrium states criticalpoint systems (implying unusual 1D systems with phase transitions) that are not in the Ising universality class systems that attain selfsimilar pair statistics under Fourier transformation and an experimentally feasible polymer model. We show that our pair functions enable one to achieve systems with a wide range of translational order and selfdiffusion coefficients $cal D$ which are inversely related to one another.

Based on this technique we assign appropriate training weights to unlabeled data to enhance the construction of a discriminative latent space. Furthermore we treat the VAE encoder and the Gaussian Process (GP) in Bayesian optimization as a unified deep kernel learning process allowing the direct utilization of labeled data which we term as Gaussian Process guidance. This directly and effectively integrates the goal of improving GP accuracy into the VAE training thereby guiding the construction of the latent space. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing VAEBO algorithms in various optimization scenarios.

Rajesh","Statistical Mechanics ","Acoustic emission (AE) activity data resulting from the fracture processes of brittle materials is valuable real time information regarding the evolving state of damage in the material. Here through a combined experimental and computational study we explore the possibility of utilising the statistical signatures of AE activity data for characterisation of disorder parameter in simulation of tensile fracture of epoxy based polymer. For simulations we use a square random spring network model with quasibrittle spring behaviour and a normally distributed failure strain threshold. We show that the disorder characteristics while have marginal effect on the power law exponent of the avalanche size distribution are strongly correlated with the waiting time interval between consecutive record breaking avalanches as well as the total number of records. This sensitivity to disorder is exploited in estimating the disorder parameter suitable for the experiments on tensile failure of epoxy based polymer. The disorder parameter is estimated assuming equivalence between the amplitude distribution of AE data and avalanche size distribution of the simulations. The chosen disorder parameter is shown to well reproduce the failure characteristics in terms of the peak load of the macroscopic response the powerlaw behaviour with avalanche dominated fracture type as well as realistic fracture paths.","Thu, 28 Dec 2023 09:03:05 UTC (1,804 KB)"

Despite the improved performance on known categories current methods perform poorly on novel categories. We attribute the poor performance to two reasons biased knowledge transfer between labeled and unlabeled data and noisy representation learning on the unlabeled data. To mitigate these two issues we propose a Transfer and Alignment Network (TAN) which incorporates two knowledge transfer mechanisms to calibrate the biased knowledge and two feature alignment mechanisms to learn discriminative features. Specifically we model different categories with prototypes and transfer the prototypes in labeled data to correct model bias towards known categories. On the one hand we pull instances with known categories in unlabeled data closer to these prototypes to form more compact clusters and avoid boundary overlap between known and novel categories. On the other hand we use these prototypes to calibrate noisy prototypes estimated from unlabeled data based on category similarities which allows for more accurate estimation of prototypes for novel categories that can be used as reliable learning targets later. After knowledge transfer we further propose two feature alignment mechanisms to acquire both instance and categorylevel knowledge from unlabeled data by aligning instance features with both augmented features and the calibrated prototypes which can boost model performance on both known and novel categories with less noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms SOTA methods especially on novel categories.

However the EOS of highdensity nuclear matter has great uncertainty mainly because the terrestrial nuclear experiments cannot reproduce matter as dense as that in the inner core of a neutron star. Fortunately continuous improvements in astronomical observations of neutron stars provide the opportunity to inversely constrain the EOS of highdensity nuclear matter. A number of methods have been proposed to implement this inverse constraint such as the Bayesian analysis algorithm the Lindbloms approach and so on. Neural network algorithm is an effective new method developed in recent years. By employing a set of isospindependent parametric EOSs as the training sample of neural network algorithm we set up an effective way to reconstruct the EOS with relative accuracy through a few massradius data. Based on the obtained neural network algorithms and according to the NICER observations on masses and radii of neutron stars with assumed precision we get the inversely constrained EOS and further calculate the corresponding macroscopic properties of the neutron star. The results are basically consistent with the constraint on EOS from the Huth $et~ al.$ based on Bayesian analysis. Moreover the results show that even though the neural network algorithm was obtained by using the finite parameterized EOS as the training set it is valid for any rational parameter combination of the parameterized EOS model.","Mon, 25 Dec 2023 06:50:01 UTC (106 KB)"

In response in this work we present a unified stochastic framework for direct DDPC where control actions are obtained by optimizing the Final Control Error directly computed from available data only that automatically weighs the impact of uncertainty on the control objective. Our approach generalizes existing DDPC methods like regularized Dataenabled Predictive Control (DeePC) and $gamma$DDPC and thus provides a path toward noisetolerant databased control with rigorous optimality guarantees.

In databased training traditional EAs typically use a significant portion if not all of the dataset for model training and fitness evaluation in each generation. This makes EAs suffer from high computational costs incurred during the fitness evaluation of the population particularly when working with large datasets. To mitigate this issue we propose a Machine Learning (ML)driven Distancebased Selection (DBS) algorithm that reduces the fitness evaluation time by optimizing test cases. We test our algorithm by applying it to 24 benchmark problems from Symbolic Regression (SR) and digital circuit domains and then using Grammatical Evolution (GE) to train models using the reduced dataset. We use GE to test DBS on SR and produce a system flexible enough to test it on digital circuit problems further. The quality of the solutions is tested and compared against the conventional training method to measure the coverage of training data selected using DBS i.e. how well the subset matches the statistical properties of the entire dataset. Moreover the effect of optimized training data on run time and the effective size of the evolved solutions is analyzed. Experimental and statistical evaluations of the results show our method empowered GE to yield superior or comparable solutions to the baseline (using the full datasets) with smaller sizes and demonstrates computational efficiency in terms of speed.","Thu, 21 Dec 2023 22:21:02 UTC (5,457 KB)"

Drawing inspiration from the discrepancies in forgetting we introduce the ForgetFilter algorithm which filters unsafe data based on how strong the models forgetting signal is for that data. We demonstrate that the ForgetFilter algorithm ensures safety in customized finetuning without compromising downstream task performance unlike sequential safety finetuning. ForgetFilter outperforms alternative strategies like replay and moral selfcorrection in curbing LLMs ability to assimilate unsafe content during custom finetuning e.g. 75% lower than not applying any safety measures and 62% lower than using selfcorrection in toxicity score.","Wed, 20 Dec 2023 03:18:50 UTC (389 KB)"

Implications for the equation of state and the phase structure of highly compressed baryonic matter are discussed. In view of the strong constraints imposed by the heaviest known pulsars the equation of state must be very stiff in order to ensure the stability of these extreme objects. This required stiffness limits the possible appearance of phase transitions in neutron star cores. For example a Bayes factor analysis quantifies strong evidence for squared sound velocities $c_s^2 > 0.1$ in the cores of 2.1 solarmass and lighter neutron stars. Only weak firstorder phase transitions with a small phase coexistence density range $Deltaho/ho < 0.2$ (at the 68\% level) in a Maxwell construction still turn out to be possible within neutron stars. The central baryon densities in even the heaviest neutron stars do not exceed five times the density of normal nuclear matter.

The equilibrium point of this system commonly referred to as the set point is individually determined. This means that determining the correct amount of medication to be administered to patients with hypothyroidism requires several treatment appointments creating an extended treatment process. Because the dynamics of the system have not yet been fully explored mathematical models are needed to simulate the mutual influence of the respective hormones as well as their course over time. These models enable a deeper understanding of the functionality in the context of data measurements. Therefore two existing timedependent mathematical models are used and further analyzed to replicate this overall influence of disparate systems. Both are based on a system of two differential equations modelling the interacting hormones. The parameters of the two models are identified according to different calibration approaches by means of patient data collected in a retrospective study in collaboration with the Medical University of Vienna.

In most cases the circular and linear variables are (i) considered in isolation with dependency between variables neglected and (ii) the cyclicity of the circular variables disregarded resulting in erroneous decision making. Given the inherent characteristics of circular variables it is imperative to adopt methods that integrate directional statistics to achieve precise modelling. This paper is motivated by the modelling of biomechanical data i.e. the fracture displacements that is used as a measure in external fixator comparisons. We focus on a data set based on an Ilizarov ring fixator comprising of six variables. A modelling framework applicable to the 6D joint distribution of circularlinear data based on vine copulas is proposed. The paircopula decomposition concept of vine copulas represents the dependence structure as a combination of circularlinear circularcircular and linearlinear pairs modelled by their respective copulas. This framework allows us to assess the dependencies in the joint distribution as well as account for the cyclicity of the circular variables. Thus a new approach for accurate modelling of mechanical behaviour for Ilizarov ring fixators and other data of this nature is imparted.","Fri, 15 Dec 2023 19:15:30 UTC (335 KB)"

Traditionally this has been a manual and errorprone task; the selection of appropriate computational methods to approximate biological assays is challenging and the aggregation of computed values into a single score even more so leading to potential reliance on trialanderror approaches. We propose a novel approach for automated reward configuration that relies solely on experimental data mitigating the challenges of manual reward adjustment on drug discovery projects. Our method achieves this by constructing a ranking over experimental data based on Pareto dominance over the multiobjective space then training a neural network to approximate the reward function such that rankings determined by the predicted reward correlate with those determined by the Pareto dominance relation. We validate our method using two case studies. In the first study we simulate DesignMakeTestAnalyse (DMTA) cycles by alternating reward function updates and generative runs guided by that function. We show that the learned function adapts over time to yield compounds that score highly with respect to evaluation functions taken from the literature. In the second study we apply our algorithm to historical data from four real drug discovery projects. We show that our algorithm yields reward functions that outperform the predictive accuracy of humandefined functions achieving an improvement of up to 0.4 in Spearmans correlation against a ground truth evaluation function that encodes the target drug profile for that project. Our method provides an efficient datadriven way to configure reward functions for GMD and serves as a strong baseline for future research into transformative approaches for the automation of drug discovery.","Fri, 15 Dec 2023 15:09:16 UTC (38 KB)"

We test its incorporation in BORG for sampling cosmic initial conditions using mock data based on nonlinear largescale structures from $N$body simulations and Gaussian noise. The method efficiently and accurately explores the highdimensional parameter space of initial conditions fully extracting the crosscorrelation information of the data field binned at a resolution of $1.95h^{1}$ Mpc. Percentlevel agreement with the ground truth in the power spectrum and bispectrum is achieved up to the Nyquist frequency $k_mathrm{N} approx 2.79h ; mathrm{Mpc}^{1}$. Posterior resimulations  using the inferred initial conditions for $N$body simulations  show that the recovery of information in the initial conditions is sufficient to accurately reproduce halo properties. In particular we show highly accurate $M_{200mathrm{c}}$ halo mass function and stacked density profiles of haloes in different mass bins $[0.85316]	imes 10^{14}M_{odot}h^{1}$.

Such an observation favors soft nuclear models that may be challenged by the observation of massive compact stars. In contrast the recent PREXII experiment concerning the neutron skin thickness of $^{208}$Pb points towards stiff equations of state that favor larger compact star radii. In the present study we aim to explore the compatibility between stiff hadronic equations of state (favored by PREXII) and the HESS J1731347 remnant in the context of hybrid stars. For the construction of hybrid equations of state we use three widely employed Skyrme models combined with the wellknown vector MIT bag model. Furthermore we consider two different scenarios concerning the energy density of the bag. In the first case that of a constant bag parameter we find that the resulting hybrid equations of state are strongly disfavored by the observation of $sim2 M_odot$ pulsars. However the introduction of a Gaussian density dependence yields results that are compatible with the conservative $2 M_odot$ constraint. The utilization of recent data based on the observation of PSR J0030+0451 PSR J09520607 and GW190814 allows for the imposition of additional constraints on the relevant parameters and the stiffness of the two phases. Interestingly we find that the derived hybrid equations of state do not satisfy the PSR J0030+0451 constraints in $1sigma$ and only marginally agree with the $2sigma$ estimations. In addition we estimate that the observation of massive pulsars like PSR~J09520607 in combination with the existence of HESS J1731347 may require a strong phase transition below $sim 1.7n_0$. Finally we show that the supermassive compact object involved in GW190814 could potentially be explained as a rapidly rotating hybrid star.","Tue, 12 Dec 2023 09:40:05 UTC (2,762 KB)"

Image data is critical material for studying high myopia and pathological myopia. Measurements of spherical equivalent and axial length are the gold standards for identifying high myopia but the available image data for matching them is scarce. In addition the criteria for defining high myopia vary from study to study and therefore the inclusion of samples in automated screening efforts requires an appropriate assessment of interpretability. In this work we propose a model called adjustable robust transformer (ARTran) for high myopia screening of optical coherence tomography (OCT) data. Based on vision transformer we propose anisotropic patch embedding (APE) to capture more discriminative features of high myopia. To make the model effective under variable screening conditions we propose an adjustable class embedding (ACE) to replace the fixed class token which changes the output to adapt to different conditions.

FedGC is a simpletoimplement framework as it only introduces a oneshot step of data generation. In data generation we summarize three crucial and worthexploring aspects (budget allocation prompt design and generation guidance) and propose three solution candidates for each aspect. Specifically to achieve a better tradeoff between data diversity and fidelity for generation guidance we propose to generate data based on the guidance of prompts and real data simultaneously. The generated data is then merged with private data to facilitate local model training. Such generative data increases the diversity of private data to prevent each client from fitting the potentially biased private data alleviating the issue of data heterogeneity. We conduct a systematic empirical study on FedGC covering diverse baselines datasets scenarios and modalities. Interesting findings include (1) FedGC consistently and significantly enhances the performance of FL methods even when notable disparities exist between generative and private data; (2) FedGC achieves both better performance and privacypreservation.

Diverging from the traditional twostage process involving system identification and modelbased control our approach dispenses with the need for an explicit model description. By harnessing a combination of databased closedloop representation Lyapunov theory instrumental variables and a generalized sector condition we formulate datadriven linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). These LMIs are employed to maximize the basin of attraction minimize the closedloop reachable set with bounded disturbances and propose a new datadriven $ell_2$gain minimization. Through demonstrations on benchmark examples we shed light on the merits and limitations of transitioning from indirect to direct design strategies for inputsaturated plants emphasizing notable advantages in handling nonlinear dynamics.","Thu, 7 Dec 2023 12:52:57 UTC (1,281 KB)[v2] Sat, 9 Dec 2023 15:22:27 UTC (1,281 KB)"

Since diffusion models have recently emerged as the de facto standard generative framework with surprising generation results novelty detection via diffusion models has also gained much attention. Recent methods have mainly utilized the reconstruction property of indistribution samples. However they often suffer from detecting OOD samples that share similar background information to the indistribution data. Based on our observation that diffusion models can emph{project} any sample to an indistribution sample with similar background information we propose emph{Projection Regret (PR)} an efficient novelty detection method that mitigates the bias of nonsemantic information. To be specific PR computes the perceptual distance between the test image and its diffusionbased projection to detect abnormality. Since the perceptual distance often fails to capture semantic changes when the background information is dominant we cancel out the background bias by comparing it against recursive projections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PR outperforms the prior art of generativemodelbased novelty detection methods by a significant margin.","Tue, 5 Dec 2023 09:44:47 UTC (4,537 KB)"

As in traditional adversarial learning advICL is implemented as a twoplayer game between the generator and discriminator where the generator tries to generate realistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars the generator produces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying the generator inputoutput pair as modelgenerated or real data. Based on the discriminator loss the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that advICL results in significant improvements over stateoftheart prompt optimization techniques for both open and closedsource models on 11 generation and classification tasks including summarization arithmetic reasoning machine translation datatotext generation and the MMLU and bigbench hard benchmarks. In addition because our method uses pretrained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters it is computationally efficient easy to extend to any LLM and task and effective in lowresource settings.","Tue, 5 Dec 2023 09:44:45 UTC (1,923 KB)[v2] Wed, 28 Feb 2024 04:42:46 UTC (2,243 KB)"

"111","MoDS: Model-oriented Data Selection for Instruction Tuning","Qianlong Du, Chengqing Zong, Jiajun Zhang","Computation and Language ","Instruction tuning has become the de facto method to equip large language models (LLMs) with the ability of following user instructions. Usually hundreds of thousands or millions of instructionfollowing pairs are employed to finetune the foundation LLMs. Recently some studies show that a small number of highquality instruction data is enough. However how to select appropriate instruction data for a given LLM is still an open problem. To address this problem in this paper we present a modeloriented data selection (MoDS) approach which selects instruction data based on a new criteria considering three aspects quality coverage and necessity. First our approach utilizes a quality evaluation model to filter out the highquality subset from the original instruction dataset and then designs an algorithm to further select from the highquality subset a seed instruction dataset with good coverage. The seed dataset is applied to finetune the foundation LLM to obtain an initial instructionfollowing LLM. Finally we develop a necessity evaluation model to find out the instruction data which are performed badly in the initial instructionfollowing LLM and consider them necessary instructions to further improve the LLMs. In this way we can get a small highquality broadcoverage and highnecessity subset from the original instruction datasets. Experimental results show that the model finetuned with 4000 instruction pairs selected by our approach could perform better than the model finetuned with the full original dataset which includes 214k instruction data.","Mon, 27 Nov 2023 09:33:13 UTC (641 KB)"

Privacy regulations such as the EU GDPR the EU Code of Conduct on agricultural data sharing by contractual agreement and the proposed EU AI law have been created to address the issue of data privacy and provide specific guidelines on when and how data can be shared between organizations.

The present investigation proposes a new approach to identify a set of nondominated neural network models for further selection by the decision maker. A new coevolution approach is proposed to simultaneously select the features and topology of neural networks (collectively referred to as neural architecture) where the features are viewed from a topological perspective as input neurons. Further the coevolution is posed as a multicriteria problem to evolve sparse and efficacious neural architectures. The well known dominance and decomposition based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms are augmented with a nongeometric crossover operator to diversify and balance the search for neural architectures across conflicting criteria. Moreover the coevolution is augmented to accommodate the data based implications of distinct market behaviors prior to and during the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic. A detailed comparative evaluation is carried out with the conventional sequential approach of feature selection followed by neural topology design as well as a scalarized coevolution approach.

Based on laboratory experiments we have shown that most of this absorption feature is due to ammonium (NH4+) salts mixed with the dark surface material. The depth of the band is compatible with semivolatile ammonium salts being a major reservoir of nitrogen in the comet which could dominate over refractory organic matter and volatile species. These salts may thus represent the longsought reservoir of nitrogen in comets possibly bringing their nitrogentocarbon ratio in agreement with the solar value. Moreover the reflectance spectra of several asteroids are compatible with the presence of NH4+ salts at their surfaces. The presence of such salts and other NH4+bearing compounds on asteroids comets and possibly in protostellar environments suggests that NH4+ may be a tracer of the incorporation and transformation of nitrogen in ices minerals and organics at different phases of the formation of the Solar System.","Mon, 20 Nov 2023 12:29:05 UTC (215 KB)"

However when noise is present the persistency of excitation condition based on the closedloop data may be undermined rendering the SDP infeasible. To address this issue an auxiliary functionbased switching control law is proposed which only requires intermittent SDP solutions when its feasibility is guaranteed. By analyzing the relationship between the controller and the system switching times it is shown that the proposed controller guarantees inputtostate practical stability (ISpS) of the closedloop switched linear system provided that the noise is bounded and the dynamics switches slowly enough.

Fung, Qing Lian, Xingyao Wang, Yangyi Chen, Heng Ji, Tong Zhang","Computation and Language ","Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous domains with their impressive performance but still face their challenges. A predominant issue is the propensity for these models to generate nonexistent facts a concern termed hallucination. Our research is motivated by the observation that previous instruction tuning methods force the model to complete a sentence no matter whether the model knows the knowledge or not. When the question is out of the parametric knowledge it will try to make up something and fail to indicate when it lacks knowledge. In this paper we present a new approach called RefusalAware Instruction Tuning (RTuning). This approach is formalized by first identifying the knowledge gap between parametric knowledge and the instruction tuning data. Then we construct the refusalaware data based on the knowledge intersection to tune LLMs to refrain from responding to questions beyond its parametric knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate this new instruction tuning approach effectively improves a models ability to answer known questions and refrain from answering unknown questions. Furthermore when tested on outofdomain datasets the refusal ability was found to be a metaskill that could be generalized to other tasks. Further analysis surprisingly finds that learning the uncertainty during training displays a better ability to estimate uncertainty than uncertaintybased testing.

To evaluate models generalization for papers published at various times we reformulate the problem by partitioning data based on specific time points to mirror realworld conditions. Extensive experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that DPPDCC significantly outperforms baselines for previously freshly and immediately published papers.

Overall 2636% are women (from 2014 to 2016) up to 2% report nonbinary genders. 1114% report that they are racial or ethnic minorities where they live. The fraction of women drops with seniority and is also lower among collaboration leadership. Men in SDSSIV were more likely to report being in a leadership role and for the role to be funded and formally recognized. SDSSIV collaboration members are twice as likely to have a parent with a college degree than the general population and are ten times more likely to have a parent with a PhD. This trend is slightly enhanced for female collaboration members. Despite this the fraction of first generation college students (FGCS) is significant (31%). This fraction increased among collaboration members who are racial or ethnic minorities (4050%) and decreased among women (1525%). SDSSIV implemented many inclusive policies and established a dedicated committee the Committee on INclusiveness in SDSS (COINS). More than 60% of the collaboration agree that the collaboration is inclusive; however collaboration leadership more strongly agree with this than the general membership. In this paper we explain these results in full including the history of inclusive efforts in SDSSIV. We conclude with a list of suggested recommendations based on our findings which can be used to improve equity and inclusion in large astronomical collaborations which we argue is not only moral but will also optimize their scientific output.","Wed, 15 Nov 2023 14:03:24 UTC (4,495 KB)"
"128","Taxonomy, Semantic Data Schema, and Schema Alignment for Open Data in Urban Building Energy Modeling","Liang Zhang, Jianli Chen, Jia Zou","Databases ","Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) is a critical tool to provide quantitative analysis on building decarbonization sustainability buildingtogrid integration and renewable energy applications on city regional and national scales. Researchers usually use open data as inputs to build and calibrate UBEM. However open data are from thousands of sources covering various perspectives of weather building characteristics etc. Besides a lack of semantic features of open data further increases the engineering effort to process information to be directly used for UBEM as inputs. In this paper we first reviewed open data types used for UBEM and developed a taxonomy to categorize open data. Based on that we further developed a semantic data schema for each open data category to maintain data consistency and improve model automation for UBEM. In a case study we use three popular open data to show how they can be automatically processed based on the proposed schematic data structure using large language models. The accurate results generated by large language models indicate the machinereadability and humaninterpretability of the developed semantic data schema.","Tue, 14 Nov 2023 21:00:26 UTC (714 KB)"
"129","Total Empiricism: Learning from Data","Orestis Loukas, Ho Ryun Chung","Statistics Theory ","Statistical analysis is an important tool to distinguish systematic from chance findings. Current statistical analyses rely on distributional assumptions reflecting the structure of some underlying model which if not met lead to problems in the analysis and interpretation of the results. Instead of trying to fix the model or correct the data we here describe a totally empirical statistical approach that does not rely on ad hoc distributional assumptions in order to overcome many problems in contemporary statistics. Starting from elementary combinatorics we motivate an informationguided formalism to quantify knowledge extracted from the given data. Subsequently we derive modelagnostic methods to identify patterns that are solely evidenced by the data based on our prior knowledge. The datacentric character of empiricism allows for its universal applicability particularly as sample size grows larger. In this comprehensive framework we reinterpret and extend model distributions scores and statistical tests used in different schools of statistics.","Tue, 14 Nov 2023 16:59:37 UTC (73 KB)"
"130","Online Data-driven Control Against False Data Injection Attacks","Wenjie Liu, Lidong Li, Jian Sun, Fang Deng, Gang Wang, Jie Chen","Systems and Control ","The rise of cybersecurity concerns has brought significant attention to the analysis and design of cyberphysical systems (CPSs). Among the various types of cyberattacks denialofservice (DoS) attacks and false data injection (FDI) attacks can be easily launched and have become prominent threats. While resilient control against DoS attacks has received substantial research efforts countermeasures developed against FDI attacks have been relatively limited particularly when explicit system models are not available. To address this gap the present paper focuses on the design of datadriven controllers for unknown linear systems subject to FDI attacks on the actuators utilizing inputstate data. To this end a general FDI attack model is presented which imposes minimally constraints on the switching frequency of attack channels and the magnitude of attack matrices. A dynamic state feedback control law is designed based on offline and online inputstate data which adapts to the channel switching of FDI attacks. This is achieved by solving two databased semidefinite programs (SDPs) onthefly to yield a tight approximation of the set of subsystems consistent with both offline clean data and online attackcorrupted data. It is shown that under mild conditions on the attack the proposed SDPs are recursively feasible and controller achieves exponential stability. Numerical examples showcase its effectiveness in mitigating the impact of FDI attacks.","Tue, 14 Nov 2023 14:44:16 UTC (3,661 KB)"
"131","Understanding learning from EEG data: Combining machine learning and feature engineering based on hidden Markov models and mixed models","Gabriel Rodrigues Palma, Conor Thornberry, Seán Commins, Rafael de Andrade Moral","Quantitative Methods ","Theta oscillations ranging from 48 Hz play a significant role in spatial learning and memory functions during navigation tasks. Frontal theta oscillations are thought to play an important role in spatial navigation and memory. Electroencephalography (EEG) datasets are very complex making any changes in the neural signal related to behaviour difficult to interpret. However multiple analytical methods are available to examine complex data structure especially machine learning based techniques. These methods have shown high classification performance and the combination with feature engineering enhances the capability of these methods. This paper proposes using hidden Markov and linear mixed effects models to extract features from EEG data. Based on the engineered features obtained from frontal theta EEG data during a spatial navigation task in two key trials (first last) and between two conditions (learner and nonlearner) we analysed the performance of six machine learning methods (Polynomial Support Vector Machines Nonlinear Support Vector Machines Random Forests KNearest Neighbours Ridge and Deep Neural Networks) on classifying learner and nonlearner participants. We also analysed how different standardisation methods used to preprocess the EEG data contribute to classification performance. We compared the classification performance of each trial with data gathered from the same subjects including solely coordinatebased features such as idle time and average speed. We found that more machine learning methods perform better classification using coordinatebased data. However only deep neural networks achieved an area under the ROC curve higher than 80% using the theta EEG data alone. Our findings suggest that standardising the theta EEG data and using deep neural networks enhances the classification of learner and nonlearner subjects in a spatial learning task.","Tue, 14 Nov 2023 12:24:12 UTC (1,761 KB)"

A root cause of these issues is the lack of understanding of the complex dynamics of education including teacherstudent interactions collaborative learning and classroom environment. To overcome these challenges and fully utilize the potential of ML in education software practitioners need to work closely with educators and students to fully understand the context of the data (the backbone of ML applications) and collaboratively define the ML data specifications. To gain a deeper understanding of such a collaborative process we conduct ten codesign sessions with ML software practitioners educators and students. In the sessions teachers and students work with ML engineers UX designers and legal practitioners to define dataset characteristics for a given ML application. We find that stakeholders contextualize data based on their domain and procedural knowledge proactively design data requirements to mitigate downstream harms and data reliability concerns and exhibit rolebased collaborative strategies and contribution patterns.

In our previous work we developed a databased generalization of the iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) to design closedloop feedback control for highdimensional dynamical systems with partial state observation. This method required perfect simulation rollouts which are not realistic in real applications. In this work we briefly introduce this method and explore its efficacy under process and sensing uncertainties. We prove that in the fully observed case where the system dynamics are corrupted with noise but the measurements are perfect it still converges to the global minimum. However in the partially observed case where both process and measurement noise exist in the system this method converges to a biased optimum. Thus multiple rollouts need to be averaged to retrieve the true optimum. The analysis is verified in two nonlinear robotic examples simulated in the above cases.","Wed, 8 Nov 2023 17:39:07 UTC (987 KB)"

However many realworld datasets with low intrinsic dimensionality reside in an ambient space of much higher dimensionality. We show that in this case vanilla persistent homology becomes very sensitive to noise and fails to detect the correct topology. The same holds true for most existing refinements of persistent homology. As a remedy we find that spectral distances on the $k$nearestneighbor graph of the data such as diffusion distance and effective resistance allow persistent homology to detect the correct topology even in the presence of highdimensional noise. Furthermore we derive a novel closedform expression for effective resistance in terms of the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian and describe its relation to diffusion distances. Finally we apply these methods to several highdimensional singlecell RNAsequencing datasets and show that spectral distances on the $k$nearestneighbor graph allow robust detection of cell cycle loops.","Mon, 6 Nov 2023 13:18:08 UTC (1,611 KB)"

We utilized samples from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 17 (DR17) and the ALLWISE catalog which contain spectroscopically labeled sources from SDSS. Our methodology comprises two parts. First we conducted experiments including threeclass fourclass and sevenclass classifications employing the Random Forest (RF) algorithm.

In the second part we trained various machine learning methods such as $k$nearest neighbors (KNN) RF XGBoost (XGB) voting and artificial neural network (ANN) using all available data based on promising results from the first phase. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining optical and infrared features yielding the best performance across all classifiers.

We study generalized linear models constructed using sets of feature value rules which can capture nonlinear dependencies and interactions. An inherent tradeoff exists between rule set sparsity and its prediction accuracy. It is computationally expensive to find the right choice of sparsity  e.g. via crossvalidation  with existing methods. We propose a new formulation to learn an ensemble of rule sets that simultaneously addresses these competing factors. Good generalization is ensured while keeping computational costs low by utilizing distributionally robust optimization. The formulation utilizes column generation to efficiently search the space of rule sets and constructs a sparse ensemble of rule sets in contrast with techniques like random forests or boosting and their variants. We present theoretical results that motivate and justify the use of our distributionally robust formulation.

The industry typically relies on closedloop simulation to evaluate how the SDV interacts on a corpus of synthetic and real scenarios and verify it performs properly. However they primarily only test the systems motion planning module and only consider behavior variations. It is key to evaluate the full autonomy system in closedloop and to understand how variations in sensor data based on scene appearance such as the shape of actors affect system performance. In this paper we propose a framework Adv3D that takes real world scenarios and performs closedloop sensor simulation to evaluate autonomy performance and finds vehicle shapes that make the scenario more challenging resulting in autonomy failures and uncomfortable SDV maneuvers. Unlike prior works that add contrived adversarial shapes to vehicle rooftops or roadside to harm perception only we optimize a lowdimensional shape representation to modify the vehicle shape itself in a realistic manner to degrade autonomy performance (e.g. perception prediction and motion planning). Moreover we find that the shape variations found with Adv3D optimized in closedloop are much more effective than those in openloop demonstrating the importance of finding scene appearance variations that affect autonomy in the interactive setting.","Thu, 2 Nov 2023 17:56:44 UTC (7,973 KB)"

Li, Bohan Zhuang, Mingkui Tan","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition ","Image superresolution (SR) aims to learn a mapping from lowresolution (LR) to highresolution (HR) using paired HRLR training images. Conventional SR methods typically gather the paired training data by synthesizing LR images from HR images using a predetermined degradation model e.g. Bicubic downsampling. However the realistic degradation type of test images may mismatch with the trainingtime degradation type due to the dynamic changes of the realworld scenarios resulting in inferiorquality SR images. To address this existing methods attempt to estimate the degradation model and train an imagespecific model which however is quite timeconsuming and impracticable to handle rapidly changing domain shifts. Moreover these methods largely concentrate on the estimation of one degradation type (e.g. blur degradation) overlooking other degradation types like noise and JPEG in realworld testtime scenarios thus limiting their practicality. To tackle these problems we present an efficient testtime adaptation framework for SR named SRTTA which is able to quickly adapt SR models to test domains with different/unknown degradation types. Specifically we design a secondorder degradation scheme to construct paired data based on the degradation type of the test image which is predicted by a pretrained degradation classifier. Then we adapt the SR model by implementing featurelevel reconstruction learning from the initial test image to its secondorder degraded counterparts which helps the SR model generate plausible HR images. Extensive experiments are conducted on newly synthesized corrupted DIV2K datasets with 8 different degradations and several realworld datasets demonstrating that our SRTTA framework achieves an impressive improvement over existing methods with satisfying speed.
